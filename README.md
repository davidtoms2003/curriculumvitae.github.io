Target user profile: This resume is focused on a serious company with a programmer job proposal.

`				    `For a company dedicated to programming in C++ or web programming.




Information architecture: The architecture of the website is very simple and easy to understand. I have used a very

`							`logical organization in the html. Dividing into sections each part of the curriculum as

`							`the banner above or each section as projects, studies or jobs. In this way it is very

`							`understandable for anyone and makes easier the programming work.




Visual design: In the visual aspect I wanted to maintain a serious and formal design with dark colors.

`				`A very basic style but useful for jobs like this. The organization of each section is what

`				`contributes most to the design, thus making it look orderly and easy to understand or find information.
